## 1. Introduction.
<img src="css.jpeg" height="150">

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

<a name="specificity"></a>
## 2. CSS Specificity.
CSS applies different weights to different selectors. Each weight is a magnitude higher than the other.

To calculate the specificity value (which selector will be applied), we simply look at the selector and add a value of 100 for every id selector, add 10 for every class selector and add 1 for every element selector.

<img src="css_specificity_magnitudes.png" height="300">

As you can see, each type of selector is weighted a magnitude higher than the previous one. 

<a name="bootstrap"></a>
## 3. Bootstrap.
Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery. 

Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. <br />

<a name="units"></a>
## 4. CSS units of measurement.
One of the things you’ll use every day in CSS are units. They are used to set lengths, paddings, margins, align elements and so on.

**Absolute lengths units : always the same size and not relative to anything else**

| Counter | Unit  | Name               | Equivalent to        |
|-------- |-------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 1       | cm    | Centimeters        | 1cm = 96px/2.54      |
| 2       | mm    | Milimiters         | 1mm = 1/10th of 1 cm |
| 3       | Q     | Quarter-milimeters | 1Q = 1/40th of 1cm   |
| 4       | in    | Inches             | 1in = 2.54cm = 96px  |
| 5       | pc    | Picas              | 1pc = 1/16th of 1in  |
| 6       | pt    | Points             | 1pt = 1/72th of 1in  |
| 7       | px    | Pixels             | 1px = 1/96th of 1in  |

Most of these values are more useful when used for print, rather than screen output. For example we don't typically use cm (centimeters) on screen. The only value that you will commonly use is px (pixels). <br /><br />

**Relative lengths units : relative to something else, perhaps the size of the parent element's font, or the size of the viewport**

| Counter | Unit  | Relative to                                                         | 
|-------- |-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | em    | Font size of the element.                                           | 
| 2       | ex    | x-height of the element's font.                                     |
| 3       | ch    | The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font. | 
| 4       | rem   | Font size of the root element.                                      | 
| 5       | lh    | Line height of the element.                                         | 
| 6       | vw    | 1% of the viewport's width.                                         | 
| 7       | vh    | 1% of the viewport's height.                                        |
| 8       | vmin  | 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.                             |
| 9       | vmax  | 1% of the viewport's larger dimension.                              |
| 10      | %     | Parent element                                                      |

The benefit of using relative units is that with some careful planning you can make it so the size of text or other elements scale relative to everything else on the page.

## 6. GitHub notes
Initialize repository, adding GitHub remote repository and check the remote repository.
```
$ git init
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/syakirharis25/CSS.git
$ git remote -v
$ git status
```

If there is an error message.
```
! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https:///github.com/syakirharis25/css.git'
```

Then do this command.
```
$ git merge origin/master --allow-unrelated-histories
$ git push origin master
```

If the files on the local machine and remote still not merge then do this command.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/syakirharis25/CSS
```
