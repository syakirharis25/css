			The Road not Taken - By Robert Frost <br />
			Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br />
			And sorry I could not travel both </br />
			And be one traveler, long I stood <br />
			And looked down one as far as I could <br />
			To where it bent in the undergrowth;
		</p>
		<p class="para2">
			Then took the other, as just as fair, <br />
			And having perhaps the better claim, <br />
			Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br />
			Though as for that the passing there <br />
			Had worn them really about the same,
		</p>

		<p class="para3">
			how are you? <br />
			how may I help you?
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p class="para4" style="font-size: 16pt;">
			Your query will be addressed soon.
