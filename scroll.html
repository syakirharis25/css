		<h1>Sweet Child O' Mine</h1>
		<p>She's got a smile that it seems to me<br />
		Reminds me of childhood memories<br />
		Where everything<br />
		Was as fresh as the bright blue sky<br />
		<br />
		Now and then when I see her face<br />
		She takes me away to that special place<br />
		And if I stared too long<br />
		I'd probably break down and cry<br />
		<br />
		Sweet child o' mine<br />
		Sweet love of mine<br />
		<br />
		She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br />
		As if they thought of rain<br />
		I'd hate to look into those eyes<br />
		And see an ounce of pain<br />
		<br />
		Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place<br />
		Where as a child I'd hide<br />
		And pray for the thunder and the rain<br />
		To quietly pass me by<br />
		</p>
