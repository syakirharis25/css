		<h1>My favourite Pink Floyd albums</h1>
		<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
		<li><b>Dark Side of the Moon</b>: The Dark Side of the Moon is 
		the eighth album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released 
		on 1 March 1973. It built on ideas explored in earlier recordings 
		and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that 
		characterised their work following the departure of 1968 of founder member,
		principal composer, and lyricist, Syd Barrett. The themes on The Dark Side 
		of The Moon include conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, 
		the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.</li>

		<li><b>Wish You Were Here</b>: Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album
		by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in 12 September 1975.
		Inspired by material the group composed while performing around Europe, 
		Wish You Were Here was recorded in numerous recording sessions at London's Abbey
		Road Studios. Some of the songs critique the music business, another expresses 
		alienation, and "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" is a tribute to Syd Barrett,
		whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years before. 
		It was lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split "Shine On" into two parts and 
		use it to bookend the album around three new compositions, forming a new
		concept similar to their previous album.</li>

		<li><b>The Wall</b>: The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released as a double album on 30 November 1979 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. Considered one of the most famous concept albums by any artist, The Wall features the band's only single to top various charts, "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2", followed with "Run Like Hell" and "Comfortably Numb". In 1982, the album was adapted into a feature film: Pink Floyd - The Wall.</li>
